# ParallelSorting
This project demonstrates the implementation of a parallel sorting algorithm using Java's multithreading capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the RecursiveTask class and the ForkJoinPool to efficiently sort large arrays in parallel. This implementation is particularly useful for improving performance on multi-core processors.
